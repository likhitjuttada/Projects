## Personal Projects
Welcome to the repo! It's nice to have you here. 
I am Likhit Juttada, a Data Science graduate student at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Artificial Intelligence has been at the center of the majority of scientific breakthroughs in recent times, I find the field very interesting and aspire to become a Machine Learning Engineer someday!

In this repo, I will be posting my projects and related files that I experiment with during my Machine machine-learning journey. 

I would greatly appreciate any guidance or feedback from the experts.

Thank you!
