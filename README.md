## Personal Projects
Welcome to the repo! It's nice to have you here. 
I am a current Data Science graduate student at the University at Buffalo. I find the concepts of Machine Learning intriguing and am constantly inspired by the potential of ML. I try to keep myself actively engaged in learning the related concepts. MyÂ passion for Machine Learning motivated me to put up this repository, where I post regular updates on my Machine Learning journey. 

Here I try to explain the concepts of Machine Learning based on my understanding of the subject in the form of Jupyter notebooks

The datasets and images utilized in the notebooks are from the internet and I do not make any claims regarding the ownership of the same.

There could be instances where I might make mistakes with the code or approach, In such cases, please be kind enough to point out the errors.

Thank you,
